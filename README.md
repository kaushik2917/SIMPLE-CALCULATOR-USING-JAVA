# SIMPLE-CALCULATOR-USING-JAVA

🔶 𝗣𝗿𝗼𝗷𝗲𝗰𝘁 𝗜𝗻𝗳𝗼𝗿𝗺𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻:

🔹 𝗢𝗯𝗷𝗲𝗰𝘁𝗶𝘃𝗲:
To develop a simple GUI-based calculator in Java that can perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

🔹 𝗗𝗲𝘀𝗰𝗿𝗶𝗽𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻:
This project implements a basic calculator using Java Swing for GUI development. The calculator allows users to input two numbers and perform arithmetic operations with the help of buttons. The result is displayed in a text field.

🔹 𝗙𝗲𝗮𝘁𝘂𝗿𝗲𝘀:
  * Graphical User Interface (GUI)
    
  * Real-time input and output

  * Basic error handling

🔹 𝗢𝗽𝗲𝗿𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻𝘀: Add, Subtract, Multiply, Divide, Clear

  * Any Java IDE like Eclipse / IntelliJ / NetBeans


🔶 𝗛𝗼𝘄 𝗜𝘁 𝗪𝗼𝗿𝗸𝘀:
  * User Input: Two numbers are input into text fields.

  * Operation: The user selects the desired operation by clicking the corresponding button.

  * Output: The result is displayed in the output field.

  * Clear: The clear button resets the fields.

🔶 𝗔𝗱𝘃𝗮𝗻𝘁𝗮𝗴𝗲𝘀:
  * Easy to understand and modify

  * Good for beginners learning Java GUI programming

  * Lightweight and doesn’t need a database or external libraries

🔶 𝗟𝗶𝗺𝗶𝘁𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻𝘀:
  * Can’t handle complex expressions (only two operands)

  * No support for scientific operations (like sin, cos, sqrt, etc.)

  * Minimal input validation

🔶 𝗙𝘂𝘁𝘂𝗿𝗲 𝗘𝗻𝗵𝗮𝗻𝗰𝗲𝗺𝗲𝗻𝘁𝘀:
* Add support for multiple chained operations

* Implement scientific calculator features

* Improve UI design using JavaFX

* Add input history/log feature
